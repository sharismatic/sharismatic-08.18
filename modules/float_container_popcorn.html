							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p> This was a redesign of an existing box for Dylanâ€™s Candy Bar popcorn. The line previously felt stagnant, oddly corporate and altogether off-brand. I felt that the packaging should be more whimsical.

								The revision was inspired by circus tents. The die-cut windows are shaped like popcorn kernels making the boxes a little more playful.</p>
								<h3>Roles</h3>
								<p> Art direction, design and production.</p>

								<h3>BEFORE</h3>
								<p>This are the popcorn boxes before the redesign. These felt strangely off-brand, despite the use of the signature stripe and logo.</p>
